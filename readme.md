# E-Scraper

E-Scraper is a CLI content scraper for various websites. It's cross-platform, allowing you to run it on all operating systems assuming you've installed at least nodejs 12.

E-Scraper is currenly a bit rough around the edges but it gets the job done.

The goal for this project was for creating a convenient local copy either for offline or archival purposes.
